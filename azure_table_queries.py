azure_table_queries.py
This script demonstrates how to query and interact with Azure Table Storage using the Azure SDK for Python.
It provides a variety of example queries to retrieve and process car inventory data stored in an Azure Table.
Purpose:
    - To showcase different querying techniques for Azure Table Storage, including filtering, combining conditions,
      partial matches, sorting, and counting entities.
    - To serve as an educational resource for students or developers learning how to use Azure Table Storage in Python.
Main Features:
    1. Query all cars in a specific category (PartitionKey).
    2. Retrieve cars below a certain price threshold.
    3. Filter cars by color.
    4. Find cars from a specific year.
    5. Combine multiple conditions using AND logic.
    6. Combine multiple conditions using OR logic.
    7. Perform partial matches (e.g., models starting with a specific letter).
    8. Query cars within a price range.
    9. Sort query results manually by price.
    10. Count the total number of cars in the inventory.
Requirements:
    - Azure Table Storage account credentials (account name and key).
    - The Azure SDK for Python (`azure-data-tables`).
Configuration:
- Set the `username` variable to your own identifier (letters and numbers only).
- Update Azure Storage credentials (`account_name` and `account_key`) as needed.
Note:
    - The queries assume a table schema with fields such as PartitionKey, make, model, price, color, and year.
